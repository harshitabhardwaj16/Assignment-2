<p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-
    web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for
    typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

    Bootstrap is the seventh-most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 142,000 stars,
    behind freeCodeCamp (almost 312,000 stars) and marginally behind Vue.js framework.
    According to Alexa Rank, Bootstrap is in the top-2000 in the USA while vuejs.org is in the
    top-7000 in the USA. </p>
